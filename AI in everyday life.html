<h1><b>AI in Everyday Life</b></h1>
<ol tpye="1">
<li><h3><b>Online shopping and advertising</b></h3></li>
<p>
Artificial intelligence is widely used to provide personalised recommendations to people, based for example on their previous searches and purchases or other online behaviour. AI is hugely important in commerce: optimising products, planning inventory, logistics etc.
</p>
<li><h3><b>Web Search</b></h3></li>
<p>
Search engines learn from the vast input of data, provided by their users to provide relevant search results.
</p>
<li><h3><b>Digital Personal Assistants</b></h3></li>
<p>
Smartphones use AI to provide services that are as relevant and personalised as possible. Virtual assistants answering questions, providing recommendations and helping organise daily routines have become ubiquitous.
</p>
<li><h3><b>Machine Translations</b></h3></li>
<p>
Language translation software, either based on written or spoken text, relies on artificial intelligence to provide and improve translations. This also applies to functions such as automated subtitling.
</p>
<li><h3><b>Cars</b></h3></li>
<p>
While self-driving vehicles are not yet standard, cars already use AI-powered safety functions. The EU has for example helped to fund VI-DAS, automated sensors that detect possible dangerous situations and accidents. Navigation is largely AI-powered.
</p>
<li><h3><b>Cybersecurity</b></h3></li>
<p>
AI systems can help recognise and fight cyberattacks and other cyber threats based on the continuous input of data, recognising patterns and backtracking the attacks.
