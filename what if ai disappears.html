<h1><b>What if AI Disappears!!</b></h1>
<h3><p>
Without AI, there’d be no Waze or Google Maps to show us where to go. There would be no Siri or Alexa to handle our Google searches or schedule a meeting with the CIO. Do you know that Boeing 777 pilots only actually fly the plane for seven minutes, with much of the rest being done by AI technology? Imagine what this scenario would mean for them.

<li>There would be no marketing automation.</li>
<li>No clever sales tools pulling customers in.</li>
<li>No process automation or business insights.</li>
<li>No analytics to predict future outlooks.</li>
<li>No chatbots answering simple – and frequent – customer queries. </li>
</ul></h3>
<h3><p>
AI already does a lot of the thinking for us. It’s been telling us what to do for years and we listen to it because we know it’s right. We could argue this makes us lazy, but the fact remains that AI has also liberated us from life’s mundane tasks, giving us more time to create, to think deeply about business and societal problems, and to solve them in new and exciting ways – or eliminate them entirely.
